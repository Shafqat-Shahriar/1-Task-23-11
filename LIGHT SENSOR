Definition: Light sensors are a type of photodetector (also called photosensors) that detect light.
Different types of light sensors can be used to measure illuminance, respond to changes in the
amount of light received, or convert light to electricity.

Light sensors work by the photoelectric effect. Light can behave as a particle, referred to as a photon.
When a photon hits the metal surface of the light sensor, the energy of the light is absorbed by the
electrons, increasing their kinetic energy and allowing them to be emitted from the material. This
movement of electrons, and therefore charge, is electrical current.

The photovoltaic effect is similar to the photoelectric effect in that the light is absorbed by electrons,
causing them to be in a higher-energy state. In the photoelectric effect, the electrons are ejected
from the material completely. In the photovoltaic effect, the electrons are excited from the valence
band into the conduction band, but remain within the same material.
