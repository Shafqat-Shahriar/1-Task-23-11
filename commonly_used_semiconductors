Silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) are the most commonly used semiconductors
in electronic devices.

Other materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs) and indium phosphide (InP) are
also used, especially in high-speed and optoelectronic(the study and application
of light-emitting or light-detecting devices) applications.
