Measuring performance of Algorithms

We can evaluate an algorithm’s performance in four ways:
 Completeness: Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one?
 Optimality: Does the strategy find the optimal solution, as defined on page 68?
 Time complexity: How long does it take to find a solution?
 Space complexity: How much memory is needed to perform the search?
